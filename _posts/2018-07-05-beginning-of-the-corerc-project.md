title: Beginning of the CoreRC Project
---

Hi, I am Fan Jiang from the Southern University of Science and Technology. Today I am pleased to announce the beginning of my long-term project, CoreRC.

CoreRC is a robotics middleware aimed at resolving the commonly encountered problems in robotics research and applications, like obsolete code, incompatible API and real-time incapability. This project will mainly use Rust and modern C++, with Python solely for scripting. Please feel free to contact me if you want to contribute :)

CoreRC is an ongoing project. Please be careful when using the code :)
